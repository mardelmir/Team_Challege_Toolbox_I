# Team Challege: Toolbox I

### Project Overview

This repository contains the deliverables for the first part of the team challenge, which focuses on building a toolbox module for simplifying the creation of Machine Learning (ML) models. The goal of this challenge is to implement a set of functions that aid in feature analysis and selection for a Machine Learning problem, and compile them into a Python script called `toolbox_ML.py`.

This module will be used in the second part of the challenge to solve a practical Machine Learning problem.

### Deliverables

1. **Python script**: `toolbox_ML.py`

    - This script contains the implementations of the required functions.
    - Each function is properly commented and includes a **docstring** with a description of its  usage, parameters, and return values.
    
2. **Example code**:

  - The group has designed an example that demonstrates the usage of the functions.
  - This example is provided in a separate notebook or script in the repository, showcasing how the functions can be applied to a dataset.
    
3. **Presentation**:

  - A brief presentation that describes the code and demonstrates the example.
  - This presentation explains the motivation behind the design decisions and provides insights into the utility of the functions.


### List of functions:
* describe_df()
* tipifica_variable()
* get_features_num_regression()
* plot_features_num_regression()
* get_features_cat_regression()

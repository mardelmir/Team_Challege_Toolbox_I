# Team Challege: Toolbox I

### Project Overview

This repository contains the deliverables for the first part of the team challenge, which focuses on building a toolbox module for simplifying the creation of Machine Learning (ML) models. The goal of this challenge is to implement a set of functions that aid in feature analysis and selection for a Machine Learning problem, and compile them into a Python script called ´toolbox_ML.py´.

This module will be used in the second part of the challenge to solve a practical Machine Learning problem.

### List of functions:
* describe_df()
* tipifica_variable()
* get_features_num_regression()
* plot_features_num_regression()
* get_features_cat_regression()
